The script *graphlan_annot_2022.R* generates the *myannotR_2022.txt* file used as an input annotation file for the script *myspecies_2022.sh* to generate the graphlan phylogenetic tree image.

The script takes as input the ribonuclease information from the raw data files provided by the EGGnog database, as well as the species and genome annotation files in the *raw_data* directory, along with fivepseq output statistics in the *taxon.stat.txt* and the *mup.stats.txt* files, and visual parameters in the *rings_2022.txt* file.
